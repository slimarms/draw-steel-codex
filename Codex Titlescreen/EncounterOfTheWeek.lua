--Encounter of the Week: a dev-gated game mode where groups of players fight
--an AI-run encounter on a weekly map. This file holds the dev setting gate,
--the global entry point, and the titlescreen screen. The titlescreen's
--top-right link (CodexTitlescreen.lua) calls EncounterOfTheWeek.ShowScreen().
--Design/plan doc: EncounterOfTheWeek/EncounterOfTheWeek.md.
--
--This lives in the Codex Titlescreen module (NOT the EncounterOfTheWeek mod)
--because separate dev codemods only load in games that install them -- the
--titlescreen runs in the local lobby game, which loads only the core codex.
--It must be registered before CodexTitlescreen.lua, which reads the global.
--
--The screen is the town of Blackbottom: the town map with clickable
--locations (the Hero's Guild, the Town Gate, the Graveyard) and the player's
--active heroes along the bottom. It connects to the Blackbottom City -- a
--server-arbitrated lobby (chat, presence, the parties roster) that also
--stores every account's heroes -- through the engine's lobbies bridge
--(lobbies:Connect, route "city"). All city state is written server-side;
--this UI renders the document and sends typed requests. The roster, the
--Guild and the Graveyard live in EotwRoster.lua; the hero cards in
--EotwHeroCard.lua.

--== portrait warm-up ==================================================

--built cold paints in halves: some cards drawn, a hitch while the rest
--decode, then the remainder popping in. Nothing in the engine preloads an
--image on request -- a texture streams because a live panel references it
--(ImageDownloader.SetImageByIdentifier, see Assets/IMAGE_MANAGEMENT.md) --
--so opening the EotW screen mounts a warmer instead: one 1x1 panel per
--eligible portrait, stacked invisibly in the screen's top-left corner,
--whose only job is to make the engine fetch the texture. By the time the
--player reaches the picker the images are resident and the grid paints in
--one pass. Nothing blocks on this: a portrait that has not arrived yet
--just behaves as it does today.
--
--Eligible = the heroes the picker can actually offer: this machine's
--titlescreen heroes and the module's pregens. Other players' heroes are
--skipped deliberately -- their portraits are per-game cloud assets that do
--not resolve here at all, which is why those cards show a silhouette.
--
--Image ids resolve by id alone; panel size selects no mip and no
--thumbnail, so a 1x1 panel warms exactly the texture the full-size card
--will later use.

--Every image id the picker could need, deduped. Reads are pcall'd because
--lobby tokens and detached snapshot tokens vary in shape, and ids are not
--always strings (userdata portraits resolve through their own pipeline),
--so the dedupe key is the id itself rather than a string.
